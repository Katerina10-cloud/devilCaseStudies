Attaching SeuratObject
‘SeuratObject’ was built with package ‘Matrix’ 1.6.3 but the current
version is 1.6.5; it is recomended that you reinstall ‘SeuratObject’ as
the ABI for ‘Matrix’ may have changed
Seurat v4 was just loaded with SeuratObject v5; disabling v5 assays and
validation routines, and ensuring assays work in strict v3/v4
compatibility mode
